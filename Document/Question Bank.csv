The DML operations in a transaction either success or if anything goes wrong or occurs even with a single record could result in a rollback of the entire transaction. ,Apex & Triggers,Hard
Salesforce,What is Apex Managed Sharing? ,"Apex managed sharing provides developers with the ability to support an application’s particular sharing requirements programmatically through Apex or the SOAP API. This type of sharing is similar to Force.com managed sharing. Only users with “Modify All Data” permission can add or change Apex managed sharing on a record. Apex managed sharing is maintained across record owner changes. 
Basically, if you want to share a record programmatically we use Apex Managed Sharing. 
For example, AccountShare is the sharing object for the Account object, ContactShare is the sharing object for the Contact object, and so on. In addition, all custom object sharing objects are named as follows, where MyCustomObject is the name of the custom object:

Public: 
This means the method or variable can be used by any Apex in this application or namespace. 
Global: 
This means the method or variable can be used by any Apex code that has access to the class, not just the Apex code in the same application. This access modifier should be used for any method that needs to be referenced outside of the application, either in the SOAP API or by other Apex code. If you declare a method or variable as global, you must also declare the class that contains it as global. ",Apex & Triggers,Easy
Salesforce,Why use Batch Apex instead of Normal Apex? ,"There are various reasons why Batch Apex is better than Normal Apex. 
A Normal Apex uses 100 records per cycle to execute SOQL queries. Whereas, a Batch Apex does the same in 200 records per cycle. So, it is very fast when the execution of SOQL queries is considered. 
A Normal Apex can retrieve 50,000 SOQL queries but, in Batch Apex, 50,000,000 SOQL queries can be retrieved. 
A Normal Apex has a heap size of 6 MB; whereas, a Batch Apex has a heap size of 12 MB. 
When executing bulk records, Normal Apex classes are more vulnerable to encountering errors as compared to Batch Apex. The latter is normally error-less. ",Apex & Triggers,Hard
Salesforce,Difference between insert/update and Database.insert/ Database.update? ,"Insert/update: 
If any one of the record fail due to error then entire operation will fail. None of the records will be saved into the database, by using insert/update if we use try-catch then we can capture only one error which will cause to stop the operation. 
Database.insert/update: 
If any one of the record fail due to error then it will perform partial operation (valid records will be inserted/updated) by using Database.insert(list, false)/ Database.update(list, false). We can capture all the errors by saving result in Database.saveResult[]. ",Apex & Triggers,Hard
Salesforce,How to restrict any Trigger to fire only once? ,"Triggers can fire twice, once before workflows and once after workflows, this is documented at 
“The before and after triggers fire one more time only if something needs to be updated. If the fields have already been set to a value, the triggers are not fired again.” ",Apex & Triggers,Hard
Salesforce,What is an Apex Email Service? ,"You can use email services to process the contents, headers, and attachments of inbound email. For example, you can create an email service that automatically creates contact records based on contact information in messages. 
You can associate each email service with one or more Salesforce-generated email addresses to which users can send messages for processing. 
When defining email services, note the following: 
- An email service only processes messages it receives at one of its addresses. 
- Email service addresses that you create in your sandbox cannot be copied to your production org. 
- For each email service, you can tell Salesforce to send error email messages to a specified address instead of the sender’s email address. 
- Email services reject email messages and notify the sender if the email (combined body text, body HTML, and attachments) exceeds approximately 25 MB (varies depending on language and character set). ",Apex & Triggers,Hard
Salesforce,What is the use of Asynchronous apex? ,"In a nutshell, asynchronous Apex is used to run processes in a separate thread, at a later time. An asynchronous process is a process or function that executes a task ""in the background"" without the user having to wait for the task to finish. ",Apex & Triggers,Medium
Salesforce,What is the difference between Batch class and Queueable apex? ,"Batch Class should implement Database.Batchable interface and it should have three methods start(), execute() and finish() methods.

Salesforce,Is it possible to call future method from Trigger?   ,"Yes possible. A future method runs in the background, asynchronously. You can call a future method for executing long-running operations, such as callouts to external Web services or any operation you’d like to run in its own thread, on its own time. Each future method is queued and executes when system resources become available.  ",Apex & Triggers,Hard
Salesforce,What if I create 151 Account records using Apex? What type of exception is thrown? ,"It will throw DML Exception. Because the limit of DML operations in a single transaction is 150, so when it reaches it throws DML Exception. ",Apex & Triggers,Medium
Salesforce,What is Queueable apex? ,"Take control of your asynchronous Apex processes by using the Queueable interface. This interface enables you to add jobs to the queue and monitor them. Using the interface is an enhanced way of running your asynchronous Apex code compared to using future methods. 
Apex processes that run for a long time, such as extensive database operations or external web service callouts, can be run asynchronously by implementing the Queueable interface and adding a job to the Apex job queue. In this way, your asynchronous Apex job runs in the background in its own thread and doesn’t delay the execution of your main Apex logic. Each queued job runs when system resources become available. A benefit of using the Queueable interface methods is that some governor limits are higher than for synchronous Apex, such as heap size limits. ",Apex & Triggers,Medium
Salesforce,Explain batch apex in details? Why we use it? What are the benefits? ,"To use batch Apex, write an Apex class that implements the Salesforce-provided interface Database.Batchable and then invoke the class programmatically. 
To monitor or stop the execution of the batch Apex job, from Setup, enter Apex Jobs in the Quick Find box, then select Apex Jobs. 
The Database.Batchable interface contains three methods that must be implemented.  
start method 
execute method 
finish method 
Benefits of Batch Apex –  
Whenever a transaction is executed, Batch Apex ensures that the code stays within the governor limit.  
Until a batch is not successfully executed, Batch Apex won’t execute the following batches.  
A large set of records can be processed together on a regular basis using Batch Apex classes.  
The interface can be scheduled to run batches at different time periods.  
Asynchronous operations can be implemented by Batch Apex classes.  
Batch jobs are invoked programmatically during the runtime and can be operated on any size of records, with a maximum of 200 records per batch. You can break down a larger record data into 200 records per batch to execute it better. ",Apex & Triggers,Hard

3, Publish Subscriber model in Lightning Web Component (Two components which doesn't have a direct relation)",LWC,Easy
Salesforce,"What is difference between aura and LWC, which one is better and why?","Aura-based Lightning components are built using both HTML and JavaScript, but LWC is built directly on the Web stack. Creating an LWC is fast as it no longer requires the user to download the JavaScript and wait for the engine to compile it before rendering the component.",LWC,Easy
Salesforce,How to call LWC init method?,"You can call init method from connectedcallback like this.
connectedCallback(){ 
   // your code
}
Also To execute actions when component is rendered, use renderedCallback() method and place the required business logic inside this method.
// mySampleInit.js
import { LightningElement } from 'lwc';
export default class MySampleInit extends LightningElement {
    renderedCallback() {
        //  the required business logic to be executed when component is rendered
    }

Salesforce,What is decorators and how we can use it?,"Decorators dynamically alter the functionality of a property or function. There are 3 decorators in LWC:
1.       @api
2.       @wire
3.       @track",LWC,Easy
Salesforce,Can you tell me the concept of promises or how to call multiple method from one method of JavaScript? ,Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They are easy to manage when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations where callbacks can create callback hell leading to unmanageable code.,LWC,Hard
Salesforce,can we make connectedCallback() method public?,"No, but we can call any method marked @api in connected callback so write all your logic in method and mark it @api, and you can call that method from other components as well as connectedcallback().",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,Why LWC is faster than aura if both are using JavaScript and less server callouts?,Creating an LWC is fast as it no longer requires the user to download the JavaScript and wait for the engine to compile it before rendering the component.,LWC,Easy

Salesforce,What is a command to push data from local to scratch org? ,sfdx force:source:push ,LWC,Medium
Salesforce,What are the advantage of salesforce DX? ,"The scratch org is a source-driven and disposable deployment of Salesforce code and metadata, made for developers and automation (CI/CD). A scratch org is fully configurable, allowing developers to emulate different Salesforce editions with different features and preferences. 
Using salesforce DX we can achieve CICD(Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery ) , if 4-5 developers are working on a same module then by using scratch org each one can work on their task simultaneously. ",LWC,Medium

Salesforce,What is LMS? What are its advantages over pubsub model?,"The Salesforce technology designed to allow communication anywhere on a Lightning Page between Visualforce and Lightning Components is the Lightning Message Service.
Use the Lightning message service to communicate over a Lightning message channel to communicate between components within a single Lightning page or through several pages. The benefit over pubsub is that the communications channels are not limited to a single page.",LWC,Medium
Salesforce,When do we use strict mode?,"In normal JavaScript, mistyping a variable name creates a new global variable. In strict mode, this will throw an error, making it impossible to accidentally create a global variable.",LWC,Easy
Salesforce,What is the use of refreshApex? How it is different from windows.reload() ?,"refreshAPEX refreshes the whole page without reloading the page, whereadwindows.reload is used to reload the entire page.",LWC,Medium
Salesforce,What does Salesforce incorporate to isolate components with different namespaces?,Using lightning locker. Lightning Locker is a powerful security architecture for Lightning components. Lightning Locker enhances security by isolating Lightning components that belong to one namespace from components in a different namespace. Lightning Locker also promotes best practices that improve the supportability of your code by only allowing access to supported APIs and eliminating access to non-published framework internals.,LWC,Medium
Salesforce,Why do we use lightning data service in LWC?,It is used to create edit update record without using apex class in lightning component.,LWC,Easy
Salesforce,What is the difference between forEach and iterator?,The iterator directive has first and last properties that let you apply special behaviors to the first and last items in an array.,LWC,Easy
Salesforce,What is the difference between named and unnamed slots?,"A slot (<slot></slot>) is a placeholder for markup that a parent component passes into a component’s body. 
Named Slots – Slots are identified by their name attribute in the body of the child component. 
Unnamed Slots – An unnamed slot is a placeholder for any markup that a parent component passes into the body of the child component. ",LWC,Easy
Salesforce,Explain the lifecycle hooks of LWC?,"A lifecycle hook is a callback method triggered at a specific phase of a component instance’s lifecycle.
connectedCallback()
Called when the element is inserted into a document. This hook flows from parent to child. You can’t access child elements in the component body because they don’t exist yet. You can access the host element with this.template.
Use connectedCallback() to interact with a component's environment
constructor()
Called when the component is created. This hook flows from parent to child. You can’t access child elements in the component body because they don’t exist yet. Properties are not passed yet, either. Properties are assigned to the component after construction and before the connectedCallback() hook. 
disconnectedCallback()
Called when the element is removed from a document. This hook flows from parent to child.
errorCallback(error, stack)
Called when a descendant component throws an error. 
render()
Call this method to update the UI. It may be called before or after connectedCallback().
It’s rare to call render() in a component. The main use case is to conditionally render a template.
renderedCallback()
Called after every render of the component. This lifecycle hook is specific to Lightning Web Components; it isn’t from the HTML custom elements specification. This hook flows from child to parent.
A component is rerendered when the value of a property changes and that property is used either directly in a component template or indirectly in the getter of a property that is used in a template.",LWC,Easy
Salesforce,What happens when we try to change public property with @api decorator in lwc?,Cannot assign to read only property error occurs as this is a public property and can only be changed in parent component.,LWC,Medium
Salesforce,What is the need of CurrentPageReference in subscriber component of an event?,To set the scope of the event in same page.,LWC,Easy
Salesforce,Why do we use unregisterListener in pubsub modal?,To remove listener from the event pool so that it stops listening to the event. Unregister the event once your work is done. This removes the references of call back from call-backs variable.,LWC,Easy
Salesforce,Why do we have used Salesforce Schema to get fields API Name in LWC?,"If we use Salesforce Schema to get the Fields’ API Names, Salesforce considers referential integrity. That means, if the developer wants to delete any field referred in LWC by using Salesforce Schema, System will not allow deleting the field. So, it’s always best practice to use Salesforce Schema to define the Field API Name in LWC.",LWC,Medium
Salesforce,Why there is a need for dynamic forms?,"An instant upgrade from page layouts: Place fields and sections wherever you want.
Better page performance: Put fields and sections into accordion components or tabs to significantly improve page load times.
Dynamic layouts: Use visibility rules to show and hide fields and sections.
Simpler layout management: 
·       Manage the fields and sections on your pages in the Lightning App Builder without touching the page layout editor. 
·       Reduce the number of page layouts you need with component visibility rules.
·       Take advantage of a single assignment model for the Lightning page instead of the dual model of assigning a Lightning page and a page layout.",LWC,Medium
Salesforce,Difference between record-view form and record-edit form?,"lightning-record-view-form: lightning-record-edit-form

Salesforce,What is the difference between wired apex methods and imperative apex methods? ,"Wired Apex methods get called automatically when the component is connected or every time the reactive properties are changed. Data returned by wired apex methods are immutable. You must use (cacheable=true) to be able to call apex methods with a wire adapter. 
Imperative apex methods need to be called explicitly. If you need to call imperative apex when the component is loaded, call that in connectedCallback. Data returned by imperative apex methods is mutable. The (cacheable=true) is optional for the imperative apex methods. ",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,"After Summer 19 release, all the properties are reactive by default, then why do we need to use @track decorator? ","After Summer 19 releases all primitive data types are reactive by default, but the objects and arrays are reactive if only if their references are changed. 
For example, the component will not re-render if a single element of an array is changed or the object's property is changed. 
To overcome this we need to use the @track annotation with objects and arrays. ",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,What is shadow DOM? ,"The elements of each Lightning web component are covered in the shadow tree.  
It is called a shadow tree because it’s hidden from the common that contains it. This is how the CSS and Events are protected from other components on the Page. 
Shadow DOM is a web standard that encapsulates the elements of a component to keep styling and behavior consistent in any context. That is the reason we can't override the standard base component CSS from the custom component. 
Since not all browsers support Shadow DOM, LWC uses a shadow DOM polyfill, a code that allows a feature to work in a web browser. ",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,What is apex:commandLink? ,"A link that executes an action defined by a controller, and then either refreshes the current page, or navigates to a different page based on the PageReference variable that is returned by the action. An <apex:commandLink> component must always be a child of an <apex:form> component. 
To add request parameters to an <apex:commandLink>, use nested <apex:param> components. ",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,What is apex:outputLink? ,"A link to a URL. This component is rendered in HTML as an anchor tag with an href attribute. Like its HTML equivalent, the body of an <apex:outputLink> is the text or image that displays as the link. To add query string parameters to a link, use nested <apex:param> components. ",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,What are static resources?  ,"Static resources allow you to add the content that you want to reference it on the VisualForce page, Aura or LWC, which includes things like images, Javascript, archives, CSS files, etc. The maximum size of a static resource of an organization is 250 MB.  ",LWC,Easy
Salesforce,"Suppose a developer has created a LWC component and inside the component there is the requirement for the third party JavaScript API. Now after implementation when developer try to open to view the component, on console an error is showing “Cross Origin Error”. What is meaning of this error? ",This error comes when CSP for the third party URL is not set. This error tells that the third party url is not trusted in the org. ,LWC,Hard
Salesforce,What are decorators? ,"Decorators in LWC are the annotations which are used for providing access to a variable. The decorators are –  
@api: To expose a public property, decorate it with @api. Public properties define the API for a component. 
@track: To track a private property's value and re-render a component when it changes, decorate the property with @track. 
@wire: To read Salesforce data, Lightning web components use a reactive wire service. ",LWC,Medium
Salesforce,What are lifecycle hooks? ,"A lifecycle hook is a callback method triggered at a specific phase of a component instance’s lifecycle. These are-  
1. constructor() 
2. connectedCallback() 
3. render() 
4. renderedCallback() 
5. disconnectedCallback() ",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,A newly created component is not visible on the page builder. What can be the issue? ,Go to the meta.xml file of the component and make this ‘<isExposed>True</isExposed>’ and also add the targets to visible for specific pages. ,LWC,Medium
Salesforce,Difference between InputField and OutputField Components? ,"InputField:  
An HTML input element for a value that corresponds to a field on a Salesforce object. 
It respects attributes of the associated field. Like whether the field is unique or mandatory, if it is pick list, display automatically picklist input widget is displayed. 
If we use InputField under PageBlockSection, it always displays with their corresponding output label. 
OutputField:  
A read only displays of a label and value for a field on Salesforce object. 
It also respect attributes of the associated field like if it is currency field, the appropriate currency symbol is displayed. 
OutputField must be child of PageBlock or PageBlockSectionItem. ",LWC,Easy
Salesforce,What are the disadvantage of using Lightning Data Service?  ,"Disadvantages -   
- For now, LDS doesn’t support all the objects.  
- Lightning Data Service can only be used in Lightning Experience and Salesforce app. It cannot be used in Lightning components for Visualforce pages or other containers.  
- LDS only supports one operation in one transaction. To perform more operations in a single transaction, we have to use Apex code  ",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,What are the advantages of lightning data service?  ,"LDS is here to simplify your life. Adopting LDS means you no longer have to write your own controller code. All your data access code is contained within the LDS component, significantly reducing the complexity of your apps and pages. This reduced complexity means that you don’t have to spend as much time on performance and quality testing. Think of the cycles you can save!  ",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,Aura and LWC are built on which language? ,Aura -ECMAScript 5 and LWC – ECMAScript 6 to ECMAScript 9(Latest). ,LWC,Hard
Salesforce,What is JavaScript Remoting in Salesforce? Why we need it? ,"JavaScript remoting is a tool that front-end developers can use to make an AJAX request from a Visualforce page directly to an Apex controller. JavaScript remoting allows you to run asynchronous actions by decoupling the page from the controller and to perform tasks on the page without having to reload the entire page. 
In addition, JavaScript remoting can help alleviate view state issues while still executing in the context of the user viewing the page. JavaScript remoting is the most efficient way of calling the controller and passing data in from the page, because you can ensure that you’re passing only the data that you need each time that you make a call. 
Use JavaScript remoting in Visualforce to call methods in Apex controllers from JavaScript. Create pages with complex, dynamic behavior that isn’t possible with the standard Visualforce AJAX components. 
Features implemented using JavaScript remoting require three elements: 
The remote method invocation you add to the Visualforce page, written in JavaScript. 
The remote method definition in your Apex controller class. This method definition is written in Apex, but there are some important differences from normal action methods. 
The response handler callback function you add to or include in your Visualforce page, written in JavaScript. ",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,Why we use Promise in JEST? ,Promises run tests asynchronously. ,LWC,Hard
Salesforce,Difference between 'Promise.resolve().then()' and 'new Promise(setImmediate).then()'? ,Both do the same thing but 'new Promise(setImmediate).then()' give the task more priority. It is used in case of Imperative Methods. ,LWC,Hard
Salesforce,"Suppose in LWC an Imperative method is called inside connectedCallback and while testing LWC I have appended the LWC element into the DOM, after that I am mocking value for imperative method and expecting the result. What will be the behavior of JEST test? ","Test will give error because when we append element into the DOM, connectedCallback will execute and then Imperative method will not find any mock data. So it'll throw error of 'undefined'. ",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,Difference between mockResolvedValue and mockRejectedValue? ,mockResolvedValue is used in case of positive scenarios like - when method return data. Whereas mockRejectedValue is used to test negative scenarios like - when method throw error. ,LWC,Hard

Salesforce,List some of the styling hooks of LWC using SLDS?,"·       Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) styling hooks make it easy to customize component styling and express your brand. Styling hooks provide CSS custom properties that correspond to SLDS component blueprints and design variations. To customize an SLDS style, declare a corresponding custom property in a component’s style sheet. You can use the custom properties to style base components and custom components.",LWC,Medium
Salesforce,Is there a possibility of rendering multiple templates in LWC?,"·       Yes, Although it’s possible for a component to render multiple templates, we recommend using an if:true|false directive to render nested templates conditionally instead.",LWC,Medium
Salesforce,Why Lightning Web Component is lightweight?,"·       Because the Lightning Web Components framework is built on the code which natively runs in the browser, most of the code that you write in them is standard HTML and JavaScript.
·       Unlike the Aura Component Framework, they do not need the additional resources to be loaded.",LWC,Medium
Salesforce,When do we use @api with a function or a property?,"·       When we need to expose the property or function to the container (parent) component. Then we annotate them with @api. In simple words, to create a public property or function.
·       Note: If the public property value is set by a parent it is immutable. Mean you can change the reference but cannot change the property itself.",LWC,Medium
Salesforce,How compose components are useful in LWC?,·       It is useful to compose apps and components with a set of smaller components to make the code more reusable and maintainable.,LWC,Medium
Salesforce,When the @wire method gets called?,·       Wired Apex methods get called automatically when the component is connected or every time the reactive properties are changed.,LWC,Medium
Salesforce,How are navigation services used in LWC?,"·       To use the Navigation Service in salesforce LWC:
o   Import the lightning/navigation JavaScript module into the Lightning web component.
o   Make the Lightning web component’s class extend NavigationMixin.
o   Call the Navigate method, passing the page reference of the page you want to navigate to.
o   Ex: import { NavigationMixin } from 'lightning/navigation';",LWC,Medium
Salesforce,How to ensure FLS while working with Lightning Component?,"·       Lightning Data Services already ensures Field Level Security, and we can also use into the Apex using isAccessible, isCreateable, isDeleteable, isCreateable and etc methods of Schema class.",LWC,Medium
Salesforce,What are the commands to install jest in LWC?,"·       npm install
·       npm install @salesforce/sfdx-lwc-jest --save-dev",LWC,Medium
Salesforce,What are the considerations when using renderedCallback()?,"·       Don’t update a wire adapter configuration object property in renderedCallback().
·       Don’t update a public property or field in renderedCallback().",LWC,Medium
Salesforce,What are Boolean properties in LWC?,"·       Boolean attributes on standard HTML Elements are set to true by adding the attribute to the element. The absence of the attribute defaults the attribute to false. Therefore, the default value of an attribute is always false. Lightning web components use the same principle for boolean properties.",LWC,Medium
Salesforce,What are two ways to listen an event in LWC?,"·       There are two ways to listen for an event: declaratively from the component’s HTML template, or programmatically using an imperative JavaScript API. 
·       It is better to listen from the HTML template since it reduces the amount of code you need to write. To handle events, define methods in the component’s JavaScript class.",LWC,Medium
Salesforce,What is the use of Document and Rendrer in lightning component?,"·       Document: – A description, sample code, and one or multiple references to example components
·       Client-side renderer to override default rendering for a component.",LWC,Medium
Salesforce,Can a component’s folder contain other JavaScript files?,"·       Yes, these additional JavaScript files must be ES6 modules and must have names that are unique within the component’s folder",LWC,Medium
Salesforce,What is strict mode enforcement in JavaScript?,"·       In JavaScript, strict mode is enforced in modules but optional in regular programs. However, Lightning Locker implicitly enables JavaScript strict mode everywhere. You do not need to specify ""use strict"" in your code. JavaScript strict mode makes code more secure, robust, and supportable.",LWC,Medium
Salesforce,Why is it better to use primitive values for public properties?,"·       Primitive values require specific @api properties that clearly define the data shape. Accepting an object or an array requires documentation to specify the shape. If an object shape changes, consumers break.
·       Standard HTML elements accept only primitive values for attributes. When a standard HTML element needs a complex shape, it uses child components. For example, a table element uses tr and td elements. Only primitive types can be defined in HTML. For example, <table data={...}> isn't a value in HTML, only in Lightning Web Components.",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,How many types of query selectors are there in salesforce?,"·       The querySelector() method is a standard DOM API that returns the first element that matches the selector.
·       If you are iterating over an array, consider adding some other attribute to the element, like a class or data-* value, and using it to select the desired element.
·       The querySelectorAll() method returns an array of DOM Elements.",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,Why can’t we pass Id to a query selector?,"·       When an HTML template is rendered, id values may be transformed into globally unique values. If you use an id selector in JavaScript, it won’t match the transformed id.",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,Which features are enabled when using delegatefocus in custom components?,"·       Adds focus to the native button HTML element using coolButton.focus().
·       If you click a node inside shadow DOM and the node is not a focusable area, the first focusable area becomes focused. This is similar to when you click on a label and focus jumps into an input.
·       When a node inside shadow DOM gains focus, the :focus CSS selector applies to the host in addition to the focused element.",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,What are the considerations when using custom elements specs applied to constructor ()?,"·       The first statement must be super() with no parameters. This call establishes the correct prototype chain and value for this. Always call super() before touching this.
·       Do not use a return statement inside the constructor body, unless it is a simple early return (return or return this).
·       Don’t use the document.write() or document.open() methods.
·       Do not inspect the element's attributes and children, because they don’t exist yet.
·       Do not inspect the element’s public properties, because they’re set after the component is created.",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,How to handle “No TOKEN named tokenName found” error in LDS token?,·       Either use a global token or use a custom Aura design token.,LWC,Hard
Salesforce,Which properties do not support base components?,"·       These Lightning Design System component blueprints and their CSS custom properties aren’t supported on base components.
o   Alert—The Alert component blueprint does not correspond to a base component.
o   Modal—The Modal component blueprint does not correspond to a base component.
o   Toast—The lightning/platformShowToastEvent module does not support the --sds-c-toast-* custom properties.
o   Tooltip—The lightning-helptext component does not support --sds-c-tooltip-* custom properties.",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,List some methods to look for elements that component rerenders?,"·       The order of elements is not guaranteed.
·       Elements not rendered to the DOM are not returned in the querySelector result.
·       Do not use ID selectors with querySelector. The IDs that you define in HTML templates may be transformed into globally unique values when the template is rendered. If you use an ID selector in JavaScript, it will not match the transformed ID.",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,"Why can’t we use addEventListener(eventName, this this.handleNotification.bind(this)) ?","·       It’s an anti-pattern because bind() returns a new function and thus the component can’t call removeEventListener() with the same function instance.
·       Because the component cannot use the same function instance, the listener creates a memory leak.",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,Why LWC cannot use window or document global properties to query for DOM elements?,·       A component can only traverse the DOM and access elements that it created. This behaviour prevents the anti-pattern of reaching into DOM elements owned by other components.,LWC,Hard
Salesforce,Why do we prefer getters instead of expressions?,"·       To compute a value for a property, use a JavaScript getter. For example, to convert the name to all uppercase letters, use a getter function in the JavaScript class, not an expression in the template.
·       Getters are much more powerful than expressions because they’re JavaScript functions. Getters also enable unit testing, which reduces bugs and increases fun.",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,Why do we use iterator in LWC?,"·       value—The value of the item in the list. Use this property to access the properties of the array. For example, iteratorName.value.propertyName.
·       index—The index of the item in the list.
·       first—A boolean value indicating whether this item is the first item in the list.
·       last—A boolean value indicating whether this item is the last item in the list.",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,Why key attribute is important in iteration in LWC?,"·       Every item in a list must have a key. When a list changes, the framework uses the key to identify each item so that it can rerender only the item that changed.
·       The key must be a string or a number, it can't be an object. You can’t use index as a value for key. Assign unique keys to an incoming data set. To add new items to a data set, use a private property to track and generate keys.",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,List three different adapters for mocking wire service data in jest testing in LWC?,"·       The sfdx-lwc-jest utility has three adapters for mocking wire service data: a generic wire adapter, a Lightning Data Service (LDS) wire adapter, and an Apex wire adapter.
o   The generic adapter emits data on demand when you call the emit() API. It does not include any extra information about the data itself.
o   The LDS adapter mimics Lightning Data Service behavior and includes information about the data’s properties.
o   The Apex wire adapter mimics calls to an Apex method and includes any error status.",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,How ES6 module is used as service component in LWC?,"·       To share code between components, create an ES6 module and export the variables or functions that you want to expose.
·       An ES6 module is a file that explicitly exports functionality that other modules can use. Modules make it easier to structure your code without polluting the global scope.",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,Why mocking the data is necessary in Jest testing in LWC?,"·       Your unit testing likely involves more than just an update to a simple UI element. Your code might be dependent upon the behaviour of certain dependencies, such as imported modules, base Lightning components, and event handlers.
·       But you want your code to be in a consistent environment, free from variable behaviour and timing of server calls, database requests or remote access API.",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,What is the configuration file naming convention?,"·       The configuration file follows the naming convention <component>. js-meta.xml, such as myComponent.js-meta.xml.",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,How many different levels are there for Lightning Record Page assignment? What are they?,"·       Lightning Pages can be assigned at three different levels:
o   The org defaults 
o   App default – this overrides the assignment done at the org level 
o   App, record type, profile – this overrides the assignment done at org level and at the App level.",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,List the limitations of custom Lightning Web Components?,"·       A custom Lightning web component cannot access a Lightning web component or module in a custom namespace. It can access Lightning web components and modules only in the c and lightning namespaces.
·       A custom Lightning web component and a custom Aura component in the same namespace cannot have the same name.",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,What are the considerations when using events in LWC?,"·       CustomEvent.detail
o   To communicate data to elements in the same shadow tree, don’t add myProperty into event.detail. The consumer of the event can use the event.target.myProperty.
·       Event Propagation
o   Use events configured with bubbles: false and composed: false because they are the least disruptive. These events don’t bubble up through the DOM and don’t cross the shadow boundary.",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,What are the DOM event standards?,"·       No uppercase letters

Salesforce,How we can use component in the community builder?,·       Implements “forceCommunity:availableForAllPageTypes” interface on the component.,LWC,Hard
Salesforce,Can we display multiple templates?,"·       Yes, we can, we can import multiple HTML templates and write business logic that renders them conditionally. This pattern is like the code splitting used in some JavaScript frameworks.",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,How we can pass data from parent component to child component?,"·       LWC support one-way data transfer from parent to child. A non-primitive value (like an object or array) passed to a component is read-only. So, the component cannot change the content of the object or array. As a result, if the component tries to change the content, we will get errors in console.",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,How we can pass data from HTML to JS controller?,"·       We can use the onchange attribute to listen for a change to its value. When the value changes, the handleChange function in the JavaScript file executes.",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,How is lightning message service (LMS) important in lightning ecosystem?,"·       As Lightning Web Components gain wider adoption, LMS positions itself as the standard publish-subscribe library in the UI, enabling components in any part of the DOM to communicate.
·       LMS provides a standard means for Lightning Web Components to communicate with Aura Components. The fact that it speaks to Visualforce is a MAJOR plus.",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,What are the considerations when using Import statement?,"·       Salesforce supports many object or field suffixes to represent different types of data. Lightning Web Components supports the import of references to standard objects, as well as the import of references to custom objects (__c) only.",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,What are the different namespaces for importing of person accounts?,"·       A __pc field represents a person account, which stores information about an individual person by combining certain account and contact fields into a single record. 
·       Every custom field created in the Contact object is available for person accounts in the Account object using the __pc suffix, but this syntax does not work in an import statement.
·       Instead of importing a __pc field from the Account object, import the custom field from the Contact object to get the benefits of referential integrity.",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,What are the considerations for importing references for some external objects?,"·       External Objects
o   An __x suffix represents an external custom object, which is like a custom object, except that it maps to data that’s stored outside your Salesforce org.
o   To retrieve data from an external custom object, call a method in an Apex class that gets the data with a SOQL query.",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,How is lightning out used in salesforce?,"·       Lightning Out is a feature that extends Lightning Apps. It acts as a bridge to surface Lightning Components in any remote web container.
·       This means you can use your Lightning Components inside of an external site (i.e., SharePoint or SAP), in a hybrid app built with the Mobile SDK, or even elsewhere in the App Cloud like on Heroku or in a Visualforce Page.",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,"After Summer 19 release, all the properties are reactive by default, then why do we need to use @track decorator?","·       After Summer 19 releases all primitive data types are reactive by default, but the objects and arrays are reactive if only if their references are changed.
·       For example, the component will not rerender if a single element of an array is changed or the object's property is changed.
·       To overcome this, we need to use the @track annotation with objects and arrays.",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,Which interface should you use if you want to override a standard action?,·       You will need to use the Lightning:actionOverride interface.,LWC,Hard
Salesforce,Where do you Link a Namespace to a Dev Hub Org?,"·       From the App Launcher menu, select Namespace Registries.",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,Why do we use expressions in salesforce?,"·       It is used to make calculations and access the data within component mark up. Use expressions for dynamic output.
·       Syntax: {! expression} Ex: {! v. courseName}
·       Note: This syntax is only used in mark up (.app or .cmp files), but in JavaScript use string syntax to evaluate an expression (“v.courseName”).",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,How many types of expressions are there in salesforce?,"·       Different types of expressions are as follows:
o   Bound Expression: Whenever the value is changed, the expression will reflect the change and affect that value in the component. This is dynamic change.
§  Syntax: {! value}
o   Unbound Expression: Whenever the value is changed, the expression will not reflect the change and static value will be displayed in the component. This is static in nature.
§  Syntax: {# value}",LWC,Hard

·       Standard Action Overrides, Custom Actions, Global Actions, List View Actions, Related List View Actions
·       Chatter Extensions",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,Why Bubbling and composed events are not recommended in event propagation?,"·       Bubbling and composed events are not recommended because they bubble up the entire DOM tree, across shadow boundaries, and through parent components (unless stopped). If you configure an event with bubbles: true and composed: true, the event type becomes part of the component’s public API. It also forces the consuming component and all of its ancestors to include the event as part of their APIs.",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,What is the purpose of Debug Mode in Salesforce?,"·       By enabling debug mode, JavaScript is directly rendered in the browser rather than minified version.
·       Debug mode also adds more detailed output for some warnings and errors. As with production mode, custom component code is not optimized or minified.",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,How to detect record change in Salesforce Server by LWC?,"·       Fetch record updates for the specified record IDs and refresh the Lightning Data Service cache, providing your wires with the latest record data. 
·       Call getRecordNotifyChange(recordIds) to notify Lightning Data Service that a record has changed outside its mechanisms, such as via imperative Apex or Visualforce, or by calling User Interface API via a third-party framework.",LWC,Hard
Salesforce,What is View State error?  ," As VF pages uses multiple Server call, So while Doing server calls we needs to maintain the state of VF page so that Values should be maintained on Page after server calls, as HTTP used for server call is state less So salesforce have created a viewState so that we can store our required data of page in order to maintain state. As Salesforce is multitenant Architecture they keep a limit for View state which is 170KB. Previously it was 135KB. ",Vf Pages,Easy
Salesforce,How to Resolve View State error? ," In Order to Resolve View State, we should use below solution:    Use Transient keyword for variable which is not supposed to store value in it after server call, Query required Field in List which is going to use on VF page, Clear the List after its use, Don’t use Get;Set; or Public for Variable which is not going to use on Page, Minimize Number of Forms on a Page. ",Vf Pages,Easy
Salesforce,What is difference between Action Function and Action Support? ," Difference between both:  Action function can call the controller method from java script. Action function cannot add AJAX support to another component. But from a particular component which already has AJAX support(onclick, onblur etc) action function can be called to call the controller method.             Action support adds AJAX support to another visualforce component and then call the controller method. ",Vf Pages,Medium

Salesforce,What is standard controller? Why we need custom Controller? ,"A StandardController object that is automatically provided for standard and all custom objects, bindable to a Visualforce page component with the “standardController” attribute. It provides a reference to a single/list of record to a set of common actions for data processing and default navigation.                                 A custom controller is an Apex class that implements all of the logic for a page without leveraging a standard controller.

The Visualforce framework includes a tag-based markup language, similar to HTML, and a set of server-side “standard controllers” that make basic database operations, such as queries and saves, very simple to perform.                                 In the Visualforce markup language, each Visualforce tag corresponds to a coarse or fine-grained user interface component, such as a section of a page, a related list, or a field. The behavior of Visualforce components can either be controlled by the same logic that is used in standard Salesforce pages, or developers can associate their own logic with a controller class written in Apex.",Vf Pages,Easy
Salesforce,What is a Visualforce Page?,"Developers can use Visualforce to create a Visualforce page definition. A page definition consists of two primary elements:                                  Visualforce markup                                                              A Visualforce controller                                                     Visualforce Markup: Visualforce markup consists of Visualforce tags, HTML, JavaScript, or any other Web-enabled code embedded within a single <apex:page>  tag. The markup defines the user interface components that should be included on the page, and the way they should appear.                                                                              Visualforce Controllers: A Visualforce controller is a set of instructions that specify what happens when a user interacts with the components specified in associated Visualforce markup, such as when a user clicks a button or link. Controllers also provide access to the data that should be displayed in a page, and can modify component behavior.",Vf Pages,Easy
Salesforce,Where Can Visualforce Pages Be Used?,"Developers can use Visualforce pages to:          Override standard buttons, such as the New button for accounts, or the Edit button for contacts                                                                             Override tab overview pages, such as the Accounts tab home page                                                Define custom tabs                                                           Embed components in detail page layouts                    Create dashboard components or custom help pages                                                                                   Customize, extend, or integrate the sidebars in the Salesforce console (custom console components)                                                                        Add navigation menu items and actions in the Salesforce mobile app",Vf Pages,Medium
Salesforce,If you want to work with VisualForce editor then how to enable it?,"For this purpose, you need to access the user details page and enable the ‘development mode’ option there to use the Visualforce Editor.",Vf Pages,Easy
Salesforce,Is there anything beyond standard controllers or custom APEX code?,"Yes, there certain cases when you need to go beyond controllers or custom APEX code. Take an example where you have to access data or actions beyond standard controllers, you need special APIs for this purpose.",Vf Pages,Hard
Salesforce,Differentiate between a custom controller and the controller extensions?,"There are some similarities and differences between the two controllers. Let us see how they resemble each other and in what aspect are they different? Both allow custom objects, custom data sets, and custom actions. They help in leveraging existing data and actions within a standard controller. What is the difference? The Custom controller should contain all data and actions within a page that will be executed later. At the same time, controller extensions allow data or auctioned that is extended in the form of buttons, links, custom overrides etc.",Vf Pages,Medium
Salesforce,What is the meaning of Properties when you use Controllers?,"With the help of Properties, you may allow creating standard getters or setters automatically and still, they are available for customization. The major benefit of Properties is that you don’t have to write tedious code for hours and secondly you don’t have to read clutters while reviewing the code.",Vf Pages,Medium
Salesforce,Explain the concept of the MVC paradigm in VisualForce?,"VisualForce pages are rendered over the server displayed to a client browser. The framework is based on a traditional MVC paradigm where Model, View, and controller are defined in three separate layers. As shown in the diagram below, the Model will define either SObjects or APEX classes. ‘View’ will define pages and components. And controller comprises of Standard or Custom APEX Code. ",Vf Pages,Medium
Salesforce,Define different ways how VisualForce pages are created in Salesforce?,There are two popular ways to create a VisualForce Page in Salesforce –                                   Method 1 - Go to the Setup Option on the top then click on Setup -> Develop -> Build -> Pages -> Create a new page. Now enter the name for the page and Save it.                                                                  Method 2 – There is one VisualForce editor where you have to write /apex/page name at the URL and you are ready to create a fresh page in Visualforce.,Vf Pages,Hard
Salesforce,Is it generally important to know Apex to make Visualforce pages? At the point when does it end up important?,"No, it isn’t generally fundamental. You can utilize standard controllers and VF part labels to achieve a considerable amount. The apex ends up essential when you require either a custom data set or custom activities to be accessible from the page.",Vf Pages,Hard
Salesforce,Describe the use of $component in VF.,"Use the  $Component global variable to simplify referencing the DOM ID that is generated for a Visualforce component, and reduce some of the dependency on the overall page structure.",Vf Pages,Hard
Salesforce,What is VF tag ID?,"Every Visualforce tag has an id  attribute. The id  attribute for a tag can be used by another tag to bind the two tags together. For example, the <apex:outputLabel>  tag’s for   attribute can be used with the <apex:inputField> tag's id  attribute. In addition to being used to bind Visualforce components together, this ID is used to form part of the document object model (DOM) ID for the component when the page is rendered.                                            To refer to a Visualforce component in JavaScript or another Web-enabled language, you must specify a value for the id  attribute for that component. A DOM ID is constructed from a combination of the id attribute of the component and the id  attributes of all components that contain the element.",Vf Pages,Hard
Salesforce,What is Live Controller (Pilot)?,"Live controller is a standard Visualforce component that dynamically refreshes a Visualforce page to display changes to data in real time. It works only in Lightning Experience. When you have a Lightning page that contains both Lightning components and Visualforce pages, use live controller to ensure that your Visualforce page's data is up-to-date. With live controller, your Visualforce pages automatically refresh the way your Lightning components do with Lightning Data Service.                                                               Live controller uses Lightning Data Service and Visualforce's rerender function to update data on a Visualforce page. When a Visualforce page is embedded on a Lightning page, live controller notifies the Visualforce page to rerender when Lightning Data Service detects an update to a record. The rerender function generates the new Visualforce page UI with the latest data server-side. It then inserts the new Visualforce page into the DOM, replacing the stale component.",Vf Pages,Hard
Salesforce,Tell us something about Visualforce Maps and its components.,"Maps communicate information more clearly than mere location data. Visualforce mapping components make it simple to create maps that use third-party mapping services. Visualforce maps are interactive, JavaScript-based maps, complete with zooming, panning, and markers based on your Salesforce or other data. Create standalone map pages, maps that you can insert into page layouts, and even mobile maps for the Salesforce app.                                               Visualforce provides a set of related mapping components. The <apex:map> component defines the map canvas, including size, type, center point, and initial zoom level. The <apex:mapMarker> child component defines the markers to place on the map by address or geolocation (latitude and longitude). You can use the <apex:mapInfoWindow> component to add customizable information panels that appear when a marker is clicked or tapped.",Vf Pages,Hard
Salesforce,Working of Visualforce Maps.,"Maps that you define in Visualforce markup generate JavaScript code to render onto the page. This JavaScript connects to a mapping service and builds the map by fetching map tiles and placing markers. If your items to be mapped don’t have a latitude and longitude, Visualforce maps can geocode their addresses. After the map renders, your users can interact with the map by panning and zooming, just like they’re used to with other map sites. The effect is as if you wrote your own custom JavaScript to interact with a third-party mapping service, but without actually needing to write it. You define the map in Visualforce and get the mapping JavaScript for free.",Vf Pages,Hard
Salesforce,What is lightning out? How can we use a lightning component in VF page?,"Lightning Out is a feature that extends Lightning Apps. It acts as a bridge to surface Lightning Components in any remote web container. This means you can use your Lightning Components inside of an external site (i.e. SharePoint or SAP), in a hybrid app built with the Mobile SDK, or even elsewhere in the App Cloud like on Heroku or in a Visualforce Page.                       Using the Lightning Out JavaScript libraries you can embed Lightning Components in an app across domains and manage interactions between the component and the app directly in the DOM.                                                                         Use this steps in the development to leverage lightning out in vf page –                                              1. Extend ltng:outApp in the application first.            2. Add apex:includeLightning tag in the page.          3.$Lightning.use() method in JavaScript is used to refer Lightning Application which extends ltng:outApp.                                                                      4. $Lightning.createComponent is used to create Lightning Component dynamically.                          5. Call $Lightning.use() multiple times on a page if needed, but all calls must reference the same Lightning dependency app.",Vf Pages,Hard
Salesforce,What is bound and unbound expression?,"Bound Expression: Bound Expression is represented as {!v.str}. Whenever the value of the string is changed, this expression will reflect the change and also affect the components where it is used, we can say the value change dynamically through this expression.                     Unbound Expression: Unbound Expression is represented as {#v.str}. Whenever the value of the string is changed, this expression will not reflect the change, we can say the value remains static through this expression.",Vf Pages,Medium
Salesforce,What are the tasks of standard controller?,"Standard controllers provides the ability to access and interact with structured business data contained in records displays in the proper user interface.                                                                        Standard controller tasks: controlling data, controlling actions and controlling navigation",Vf Pages,Easy
Salesforce,What are three binding types used as a part of Visualforce?,Given below are the three binding types:            Data binding basically refers to the set of data in the controller.                                                                   Action binding usually refers to the action techniques in the controller.                                           Component binding simple refers to other Visualforce parts,Vf Pages,
Salesforce,How will you explain the custom controllers in Salesforce? (not as it is but definition present there),"To implement custom logic with Visualforce Pages, customer controllers are needed. There is a possibility to create new functionality with custom controllers. The example of syntax is given below in the screenshot –                                   Syntax: <apex:page controller=""account"">",Vf Pages,Medium
Salesforce,Can we use standardController & controller attributes at a time?,"No, we cannot reference both attributes at a time.",Vf Pages,Medium
Salesforce,What are static resources? And how they are referenced in VF Page?,"Static resources are a new type of storage in Salesforce specifically designed for use in Visualforce pages. They are ways to store images, flash files, style sheets, and other web resources on the Salesforce servers that can be cached for better page performance.                                        They are referenced using - $Resource.resourceName",Vf Pages,Easy
Salesforce,What is the purpose of <script> tags?,Script tags allow you to create JavaScript (or other types) functions that can be used within your pages.,Vf Pages,Easy
Salesforce,What are the Global Key words?,"We have global keywords like component, User, URL, current page etc., to access various values from components on page, from user object or from url or from current page fields. To access value from each source, we have different global keywords. One such keyword is explained in above question(!$component)                              Various global keywords are:                                     I.

Page reference etc.",Vf Pages,Medium
Salesforce,Explain Visualforce namespace?,"In Visualforce, standard tags begin with word apex, where custom tags begin with the letter C. Salesforce user can register custom namespace instead of letter C.                                         Example: Standard tag : <apex:page>, Custom tag: <c:customtag>.",Vf Pages,Medium

Salesforce,What are the wizard controllers in Visualforce and how they are different from other controllers?,"They are able to manage multiple pages and state across each page that is not possible to manage by other simpler controllers in Visualforce. A Visualforce controller defines a complete set of instructions that specify what can happen when the user interacts with different components available on Visualforce pages. These components may be buttons, links, or any other action item. There are three popular types of Visual Force Controllers in Salesforce. These are Standard Controller, Custom Controller, and the Controller Extensions.",Vf Pages,Hard
Salesforce,Is there any benefit of using a transient keyword in Visualforce? (opposite ques present – how to resolve view state error),"To prevent data to be saved in view state, the transient keyword is used in Visualforce. It should be utilized for temporary variables only.",Vf Pages,Easy
Salesforce,What is the benefit of a component controller for custom components?,If you wanted to implement any business logic like how to render a component and many more things than component controllers are needed for custom components.,Vf Pages,Medium
Salesforce,Is there any way to create Dynamic VF Components?,"Yes. Dynamic Visualforce components offer a way to create Visualforce pages that vary the content or arrangement of the component tree according to a variety of states, such as a user’s permissions or actions, user or organization preferences, the data being displayed, and so on. Rather than using standard markup, dynamic Visualforce components are designed in Apex.         A dynamic Visualforce component is defined in Apex like this:                                                               Component.Component_namespace.Component_name                                                                              For example, <apex:dataTable> becomes Component.Apex.DataTable.                                       Visualforce components that are dynamically represented in Apex behave like regular classes. Every attribute that exists on a standard Visualforce component is available as a property in the corresponding Apex representation with get and set methods.",Vf Pages,Hard
Salesforce,Define some scenarios where we can use Dynamic Visualforce Component.,"Consider using dynamic Visualforce components in the following scenarios:                        1. You can use dynamic Visualforce components inside complex control logic to assemble components in combinations that would be challenging or impossible to create using equivalent standard Visualforce. For example, with standard Visualforce components, you typically control the visibility of components using the rendered attribute with the global IF() formula function. By writing your control logic in Apex, you can choose to display components dynamically with a more natural mechanism.               2. If you know that you’ll be iterating over objects with certain fields, but not specifically which objects, dynamic Visualforce components can “plug in” the object representation by using a generic sObject reference.",Vf Pages,Hard
Salesforce,Define some restrictions of Dynamic Visualforce Components.,"Not every feature of Visualforce makes sense in a dynamic context, so some components aren’t available dynamically.                                         The following standard Visualforce components don’t have corresponding dynamic representations in Apex:                                             <apex:attribute>                                                              <apex:component>                                                     <apex:componentBody >                                               <apex:composition>                                                           <apex:define>                                                               <apex:dynamicComponent>                                      <apex:include>                                                                <apex:insert>                                                                      <apex:param>                                                                <apex:variable>                                                              If a dynamic Visualforce component refers to a specific sObject field, and that field is later deleted, the Apex code for that field reference will still compile, but the page will fail when it is viewed. Also, you can create references to global variables such as $Setup or $Label , and then delete the referenced item, with similar results. Please verify such pages continue to work as expected. Dynamic Visualforce pages and expressions check attribute types more strictly than static pages. You can’t set “pass-through” HTML attributes on dynamic components.",Vf Pages,Hard
Salesforce,What is Visualforce Charting?,"Visualforce charting gives you an easy way to create customized business charts, based on data sets you create directly from SOQL queries, or by building the data set in your own Apex code. By combining and configuring individual data series, you can compose charts that display your data in ways meaningful to your organization.  Visualforce charts are rendered client-side using JavaScript. This allows charts to be animated and visually exciting, and chart data can load and reload asynchronously, which can make the page feel more responsive.",Vf Pages,Hard
Salesforce,Why Would You Use Visualforce Charting?,"Use Visualforce charting when the standard Salesforce charts and dashboards are insufficient, or when you wish to compose custom pages that combine charts and data tables in ways that are more useful to your organization.",Vf Pages,Hard

Salesforce,Explain Aura framework and its architecture? ,"Component resources contain mark-up and have a .cmp suffix. The mark-up can contain text or references to other components and declares metadata about the component. 
User Actions initiates components. Init event is raised calling controller function. 
JavaScript Controller:  
This JavaScript controller handles events within a component. It is a JavaScript resource that defines the functions for all the component’s actions. 
Example: 
myAction: function (cmp, event, helper) { 
// add code for the action 
} 
Each action function takes in three parameters: 
Cmp: The component to which the controller belongs. 
Event: The event that the action is handling. 
Helper: Helper contains functions that can be reused by any JavaScript code in the component bundle. 
JavaScript Helper:  
Helper method queues action, Lightening framework calls Apex Method (). 
Apex Controller Class:

Different types of expressions are as follows: 
Bound Expression: Whenever the value is changed, the expression will reflect the change and affect that value in the component. This is dynamic change.

Salesforce,Best practices for lightning?,"(Some of them will also help)
·       Do not put so many console logs.
·       Make the use of Salesforce lightning design system for consistent ui design.
·       Make the use of Lightning data services to avoid server calls for Dml operations.
·       Use unbounded expressions if the data across components are not required to be in synch.
·       Before you decide to use a third-party library in a Lightning component, you should reevaluate if
·       you really need that library. DOM manipulation libraries (like jQuery) and UI libraries (like Bootstrap or jQuery UI) in particular may no longer be needed when working with the Lightning Component Framework.
·       When possible, use the (sprite-based) Lightning Design System icons (using <lightning:icon> and <lightning:buttonIcon>) instead of custom icons.
·       Salesforce is slower for users who have debug mode enabled. So, do not enable in Production.
·       When appropriate consider passing the data in different components(using attributes,events or methods) rather than retrieving the same data in different components.
·       When making a call to the server limit the columns and rows of the result set. Only select the columns you need. 
·       Set a limit on the query and provide paging mechanisum if needed. Don’t return huge number of rows at once.
·       Consider combining several requests(actions) in a single composite request.
·       Cache the data when possible.
·       Caching the data at the client side can significantly reduce the number of server round trips and improve the performance tips. A storable action is a server action whose response is stored in the in the client cache so that subsequent requests for the same server method with the same set of arguments can be accessed from that cache.
·       Try to limit number of event handlers in your Lightning component. As you can guess, multiple event handler means your component would be busy in listening event changes resulting in performance overload.
·       Always try to use a component event instead of an application event, if possible. Component events can only be handled by components above them in the containment hierarchy so their usage is more localized to the components that need to know about them. 
·       Application events are best used for something that should be handled at the application level, such as navigating to a specific record. Application events allow communication between components that are in separate parts of the application and have no direct containment relationship.
·       Use helper methods.
·       To improve runtime performance, set @AuraEnabled(cacheable=true) to cache the method results on the client. To set cacheable=true, a method must only get data. It can’t mutate data.",Aura,Easy
Salesforce,Where we can use Lightning Components?,"We can use Lightning Components in the following places:

Salesforce,Can we make a Lightning Component that shows up in both the mobile and the desktop user interfaces?,"Lightning component is lightning experience ready by default and is also compatible in Salesforce1 App, it has a responsive layout therefore it adjusts its resolution according the screen size and therefore can be used on desktop as well without writing any separate code.",Aura,Easy
Salesforce,What is aura:registerevent in lightning component?,"aura:registerevent is the notifier component and it declares that it may fire a particular event, it includes ‘name’ attribute which is relevant only to component event and is not used for application event. Other attribute is the ‘type’ which lets the component know which event would be fired.Ex. <aura:registerEvent name=”Event” type=”c:EventName”/>",Aura,Easy
Salesforce,How can we communicate between two components?,"In Lightning Component Framework, the communication between two component is accompalished supported in several ways.
·       Attributes or Methods to pass data down the component hierarchy
·       Lightning Events to pass data up and around in the component hierarchy",Aura,Medium
Salesforce,How can we extend any component?,To make a component extendable we need to set value of ‘extensible’ attribute as ‘true’ of the aura:component tag.When a component extends another component it inherits all of the helper methods and attributes.,Aura,Medium
Salesforce,Why do we use @AuraEnabled annotation?,"The AuraEnabled annotation provides support for Apex methods and properties to be used with the Lightning Component framework.The AuraEnabled annotation is overloaded, and is used for two separate and distinct purposes.
·       Use @AuraEnabled on Apex class static methods to make them accessible as remote controller actions in your Lightning components.
·       Use @AuraEnabled on Apex instance methods and properties to make them serializable when an instance of the class is returned as data from a server-side action.",Aura,Easy
Salesforce,"What are the different ways to conditionally display markup, and what is the preferred approach?","Using the <aura:if> tagUse CSS to toggle visibility of markup by calling $A.util.toggleClass(cmp, ‘class’) in JavaScript code.Let’s say you have several buttons that reuse the same onclick handler.

Salesforce,What is the use of access=“global”?,"The framework enables you to control access to your applications, attributes, components, events, interfaces, and methods via the access system attribute. The access system attribute indicates whether the resource can be used outside of its own namespace.You can specify these values for the access system attribute.
Private: Available within the component, app, interface, event, or method and can’t be referenced outside the resource.You can’t access a private attribute from a sub-component that extends the component containing the private attribute.
Public: Available within your org only. This is the default access value.Global: Available in all orgs.",Aura,Easy
Salesforce,What are Local and Global ids with respect to lightning component?,"Local IDs
A local ID is an ID that is only scoped to the component. A local ID is often unique but it’s not required to be unique.Create a local ID by using the aura:id attribute. For example:Find the button component by calling cmp.find(“button1”) in your client-side controller, where cmp is a reference to the component containing the button.
Global IDs
Every component has a unique globalId, which is the generated runtime-unique ID of the component instance. A global ID (1) is not guaranteed to be the same beyond the lifetime of a component, so it should never be relied on. A global ID can be useful to differentiate between multiple instances of a component or for debugging purposes.",Aura,Easy
Salesforce,How does LDS share records among components?,"Lightning Data Service records are shared across multiple components, loading records provides the component with a copy of the record instead of a direct reference. If a component loads a record in VIEW mode, Lightning Data Service automatically overwrites that copy with a newer copy of the record when the record is changed. If a record is loaded in EDIT mode, the record is not updated when the record is changed. This prevents unsaved changes from appearing in components that reference the record while the record is being edited, and prevents any edits in progress from being overwritten. Notifications are still sent in both modes.",Aura,Medium
Salesforce,What are secure wrappers?,"For security, Lightning Locker restricts the use of global objects by hiding an object or by wrapping it in a secure version of the object. For example, the secure version of window is SecureWindow. Locker intercepts calls to window and uses SecureWindow instead. Some methods and properties have different behavior or aren’t available on the secure objects",Aura,Hard
Salesforce,How can you avoid active listeners in lightning components for better performance?,"Try to use Unbound Expression, instead of Bound Expression wherever possible. 
Try to use aura:method instead of event handler as if you use event handlers, they will create listeners in the backend to read for the event. 
Use component event instead of application event as application events are being broadcasted to all the components on the same page.",Aura,Hard
Salesforce,What are CDC events?,"CDC events are basically used to track the changes in a Salesforce record. This means, it tracks create, update, delete and undelete changes of a Salesforce Record, and fires an event when the change occurred.",Aura,Medium

Salesforce,How can you ensure that changes can be successfully deployed without overwriting changes on the Production Organization?,Being able to track and replicate changes in all environments is the only way to ensure that functionality can be successfully deployed without overwriting changes on the production organization. This may have to be done manually.,Deployment,Medium
Salesforce,What are some factors with Deployment Time?,"--Number and size of files—The more you deploy, the longer deployment takes. However, network payloads are rarely larger than 10 MB, so raw file size usually does not play a significant role. Type of components—Some components take longer to process than others. For example, custom fields, custom junction objects, and profiles take longer to deploy than other components.
--Processing time—Making a change that requires recalculating data takes an amount of time proportional to the amount of data that has to be modified. For example,changing a field type could require modifying all records that use that field.
--Test execution—When deploying to a production organization, the number and complexity of Apex tests have a large impact on the deployment time.
--Network and server availability—These are of minimal concern compared to other factors. However, consider scheduling long-duration deployments during off-peak hours so that you are not waiting on deployments during working hours or locking components from use.
--Locking—If users are working in the org during deployment, locking can affect users and the deployment.",Deployment,Medium
Salesforce,What are some best practices for running tests in your deployments to various environments to ensure high-quality deployments in production and shorter deployment times?,"Run local tests in a deployment to a development environment
--Validate your components before deploying them by performing a deployment validation
--Use recent validations that were successful in the last 10 days to perform quick deployments
--Specify the tests to run by using the RunSpecifiedTests test level",Deployment,Easy
Salesforce,What are the different Deployment Dependencies?,"Parent-child—Metadata components may depend on other components.
--Referenced file—Every file that is referenced by another file must either be included in the deployment plan, or already in the destination organization.
--Ordering—Dependencies require that components are deployed in a specific order, and within a single deploy operation, this order is handled automatically by the Metadata API. However, if you deploy a subset of components, or split your deployment into multiple batches, you must take into account the ordering dependencies yourself.
--Mandatory fields—When you create an object using the Force.com IDE or the Salesforce user interface, the tool enforces the creation of mandatory fields.",Deployment,Easy

-- Create or refresh the staging environment during the maintenance window that allows you to do a test deployment before deploying to production

--listMetadata—Returns the names and other properties of individual metadata components in your organization, along with extra information about each one. This target is useful when you want to include specific components in the package.xml, or if you want a high-level view of particular metadata types in your organization.

Salesforce,Change Set Considerations,"Force.com migration tool is best for...
Development projects for which you need to populate a test environment with a lot of setup changes—Making these changes using a web interface can take a long time.

Multistage release processes—A typical development process requires iterative building, testing, and staging before releasing to a production environment. Scripted retrieval and deployment of components can make this process much more efficient.

Repetitive deployment using the same parameters—You can retrieve all the metadata in your organization, make changes, and deploy a subset of components. If you need to repeat this process, it's as simple as calling the same deployment target again.

When migrating from stage to production is done by IT—Anyone that prefers deploying in a scripting environment will find the Force.com Migration Tool a familiar process.

Scheduling batch deployments—You can schedule a deployment for midnight to not disrupt users. Or you can pull down changes to your Developer Edition org every day.
Change Set Considerations
You can move metadata only between the production org and its sandboxes. You can't move changes between two production orgs or Developer Editions.

You can add components with a change set, but you can't delete them. You must use another method to delete components, typically manually.

Salesforce,What is difference between auth 1 and Auth 2?,"More OAuth Flows to allow better support for non-browser based applications. This is a main criticism against OAuth from client applications that were not browser based. For example, in OAuth 1.0, desktop applications or mobile phone applications had to direct the user to open their browser to the desired service, authenticate with the service, and copy the token from the service back to the application. The main criticism here is against the user experience. With OAuth 2.0, there are now new ways for an application to get authorization for a user.OAuth 2.0 no longer requires client applications to have cryptography. This hearkens back to the old Twitter Auth API, which didn't require the application to HMAC hash tokens and request strings. With OAuth 2.0, the application can make a request using only the issued token over HTTPS.OAuth 2.0 signatures are much less complicated. No more special parsing, sorting, or encoding.OAuth 2.0 Access tokens are ""short-lived"". Typically, OAuth 1.0 Access tokens could be stored for a year or more (Twitter never let them expire). OAuth 2.0 has the notion of refresh tokens. While I'm not entirely sure what these are, my guess is that your access tokens can be short lived (i.e. session based) while your refresh tokens can be ""life time"". You'd use a refresh token to acquire a new access token rather than have the user re-authorize your application.Finally, OAuth 2.0 is meant to have a clean separation of roles between the server responsible for handling OAuth requests and the server handling user authorization.",Integration,Medium

Salesforce,What are best practices for Managing Accounts and Contacts?,"
•	Know company’s naming conventions for accounts: Using established naming conventions helps everyone in the company. Names not only help find companies in records, but they can be used to denote relationships between accounts and help decide if a company or individual already exists in records. For example, if work with multiple franchises, might need to use names that make sense in a hierarchy but also help differentiate between two stores with the same name in a similar geographic area.

•	Always associate contacts with an account: Contacts without accounts—private contacts—are like a forgotten boat adrift at sea. They’re hidden from all users except system administrators, which makes them easy to forget, hard to find, and useless to colleagues.

•	Don’t let inactive accounts and contacts get lost in the shuffle: Keep an eye out for, or create a report to find, accounts and contacts without activities listed within the last 30, 60, or 90 days. Depending on business, these inactive customers may be ripe for a new product, or it may be time to exclude them from list views, reports, and campaigns so can focus on active customers.

•	Maintain active ownership: It’s hard to actively manage an account if it’s assigned to someone who isn’t using Salesforce. If run across an account or contact that’s owned by someone who moved to a different position or left company, help find the account and its contacts a new owner.

•	Keep records updated: Whenever locate new information about an account, contact, or lead, enter it into Salesforce. Salesforce data is only as good as make it.

Salesforce,What is account data skew? What problem arises due to it?,"Too many child records associated with the same parent object in one of these relationships causes account data skew.

Record Locking
Here’s another scenario: You’re updating a large number of contacts under the same account in multiple threads. For each update, the system locks both the contact being changed and its parent account to maintain integrity in the database. Even though each lock is held for a very short time, because all the updates are trying to lock the same account, there’s a high risk an update will fail because a previous one is still holding the lock on the account.

Sharing Issues
There’s a similar dynamic when it comes to sharing. Depending on how you have sharing configured, when you do something that seems simple, like changing the owner of an account, you may need to examine every one of the account’s child records and adjust their sharing, as well. That may include recalculating the role hierarchy and sharing rules. And if we’re talking about hundreds of thousands of child records, that can eat up tons of time.
",Service Cloud,Medium
Salesforce,What is ownership skew? what problem arises due to ownership skew?,"When a large number of records with the same object type are owned by a single user, this imbalance causes ownership skew. Since every record is required to have an owner, it seems like the natural solution is to skew those records onto a generic owner, such the aforementioned “Unassigned.”

When the skewed owner exists in the role hierarchy, operations like deletes or owner updates must remove sharing from the old owner and all parent users within the role hierarchy, and from all users given access by sharing rules. That’s why ownership changes tend to be one of the costliest transactional changes in the system.",Service Cloud,Medium
Salesforce,What is PK chunking?,Use PK Chunking to handle extra-large data set extracts. PK stands for Primary Key—the object’s record ID—which is always indexed. PK chunking splits bulk queries on very large tables into chunks based on the record IDs of the queried records.,Service Cloud,Easy
Salesforce,When to use bulk api data and SOAP api data loading?,"The standard Force.com SOAP API is optimized for real-time client applications that update a few records at a time. SOAP API requires developers and administrators to implement comple processes to upload data in bite-sized chunks, monitor results, and retry failed records. This method is acceptable for small data loads, but becomes unwieldy and time-consuming with large data sets.

Bulk API, on the other hand, is designed to make it simple to process data from a few thousand to millions of records. Bulk API is based on REST principles and was developed specifically to simplify and optimize the process of loading or deleting large data sets.

Using Bulk API for LDV allows for super-fast processing speeds, along with reduced client-side programmatic language, easy-to-monitor job status, automatic retry of failed records, support for parallel processing, minimal roundout trips to Force.com, minimal API calls, limited dropped connections, and easy-to-tune batch size.
